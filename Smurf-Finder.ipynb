    "# Smurf Predictor | Brandon Jackson || Richard Tang\n",
    "# This ambitious data science experiment's goal is to: given an input (summoner name), return a list of possible smurfs of that account. This project as inspried by an interview I watched with Team Liquid's coach Steve mentioned that when teams are scouting players they often need to get a full list of smurf accounts.\n",
    "****\n",
    "# For those of you who do not play the game League of Ledgends, often times a high elo (the rating system for the game) create smurf accounts to practise new champions or get lower queue time (since they must be matched up with players of their skill level as you climb the elo ladder you have fewer players as good as you). You may also want to hide a pocket pick you may bring out in the LCS/LCK/LPL/LMS/etc... So there is insentive for coaches to want to know who other players may be practising on as well as recruits they may be scouting and want to get a fuller picture. Out of respect for player's who want to hide their smurf some code that would be avalible to pulbic on github will not be posted. However, if you are a coach or team looking for software like this please contact me at Brandon@devbjax.com(Prefered) || Bjax@cs.umd.edu.\n",
