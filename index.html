This project as inspried by an interview I watched with Team Liquid’s coach Steve mentioned that when teams are scouting players they often need to get a full list of smurf accounts.</h3>

You may also want to hide a pocket pick you may bring out in the LCS/LCK/LPL/LMS/etc… So there is insentive for coaches to want to know who other players may be practising on as well as recruits they may be scouting and want to get a fuller picture. Out of respect for player’s who want to hide their smurf some code that would be avalible to pulbic on github will not be posted. However, if you are a coach or team looking for software like this please contact me at Brandon@devbjax.com(Prefered) || Bjax@cs.umd.edu.</h4>
